# Ben's Portfolio
Hello! Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. This is a selection of some personal projects I've worked on or am currently working on with links to their respective repos.

## [chess](https://github.com/bdiamond2/chess)
This is a Java-based command line implementation of chess that I made after taking CS300, which was my first Java course at UW-Madison (shoutout to the GOAT Hobbes LeGault). I wanted to create something that was heavy on object-oriented programming with complex business logic that I already knew, so chess seemed like a great fit. Currently the game is like 90% functional, but there are some edge cases that haven't been accounted for yet (e.g. two lone kings = stalemate).

## [CS559-final-project](https://github.com/bdiamond2/CS559-final-project)
This is the source code of my final project for CS559: Computer Graphics at UW-Madison, which is written in JavaScript and uses the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) graphics library. The assignment was to create a 3D "Graphics Town" with a particular theme and a certain number of different objects and behaviors. I chose to make an animated model of my beloved city Madison, WI, and there are some setpieces in there that I'm particularly proud of. (As mentioned in its README, note that the UI controls were taken from a provided framework written by Michael Gleicher, my professor.) An interactive demo is available on [the class gallery page](https://pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp23/gallery/grtowngallery/), along with some of my other classmates' projects that were selected for public display. (Mine is at the bottom!)

## [job-site-scraping](https://github.com/bdiamond2/job-site-scraping/blob/main/umich_job_scraper.ipynb)
Perhaps some of the most practically useful code I've ever written for myself, this is a program that scrapes the University of Michigan's job site and dumps the info into a CSV file. Because I currently have an Ann Arbor lease without an Ann Arbor *job*, I've been checking the U-M job site borderline-obsessively. I soon realized that it was difficult and tedious to keep track of which jobs I should apply for next, and I kept thinking, "Man, this would be so much easier if it was all in a spreadsheet." So I decided it was a great excuse to learn the basics of web scraping and wrote this little program.

## [cruddy-recipes](https://github.com/bdiamond2/cruddy-recipes)
This is currently a barebones Django implementation of a simple recipe website. It's about as interesting as it is visually appealing (i.e. not) but this was more about gaining familiarity with the basics of the Django web framework. I hope to either enhance this or create something else with Django that's more interesting soon.

## [medicaid-expansion-analysis](https://github.com/bdiamond2/medicaid-expansion-analysis/blob/main/medicaid_expansion.ipynb)
I recently applied for a data analysis job that dealt with Medicaid data, so for that I wanted to put together a small project where I pulled data from multiple sources and provided some basic visualizations. This is a Jupyter Notebook that examines quality-of-life statistics in states that haven't implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion, and stacks them up with the rest of the country. It's not very rigorous or scientific, but I did think the results were fairly interesting.

## [sqlite-demo](https://github.com/bdiamond2/sqlite-demo/blob/main/chinook_demo.ipynb)
This is a simple Jupyter Notebook that uses both pandas and SQL to display some summarized views of the "chinook" sample SQLite database. The purpose isn't to be very interesting, mainly it's just intended to be a demonstration of using SQL in conjunction with Python to display data.

## [excel-is-a-physics-engine](https://github.com/bdiamond2/excel-is-a-physics-engine)  
This was a fun, silly little project I did a few years back when I was learning how to program in VBA to write Excel macros for my job at the time. There wasn't much work to be done in the first month or so of my employment (with an employer that will remain nameless) so I wanted to test the limits of what I could do with Excel macros. Basically, I turned the cells of the spreadsheet into pixels and drew elaborate shapes with code - an Archimedean spiral, projectile motion, even a rainbow. The final pièce de résistance was a "gravity simulator" that implemented the vector form of Newton's law of universal gravitation, and I was able to tweak the parameters in such a way that simulated an earth/moon/sun-like system.
