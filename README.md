# Ben's Portfolio
Hello! Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. This is an aggregation of some projects I've worked on or am currently working on.

## [chess](https://github.com/bdiamond2/chess)  
This is a command line implementation of chess that I made after taking CS300, which was my first Java course at UW-Madison (shoutout to the GOAT Hobbes LeGault). I wanted to create something that was heavy on object-oriented programming with complex business logic that I already knew, so chess seemed like a great fit. Currently the game is like 90% functional, but there are some edge cases that haven't been accounted for yet (e.g. two lone kings = stalemate).

## [excel-is-a-physics-engine](https://github.com/bdiamond2/excel-is-a-physics-engine)  
This was a fun, silly little project I did a few years back when I was learning how to program in VBA to write Excel macros for my job at the time. There wasn't much work to be done in the first month or so of my employment at that employer who will remain nameless, so I wanted to test the limits of what I could do with Excel macros. Basically, I turned the cells of the spreadsheet into pixels and drew elaborate shapes with code - an Archimedean spiral, projectile motion, even a rainbow. The final pièce de résistance was a lightly object-oriented implementation of Newton's law of gravity, and I was able to tweak the parameters in such a way that simulated an earth/moon/sun-like system.

## [job-site-scraping](https://github.com/bdiamond2/job-site-scraping)  
Perhaps some of the most practically useful code I've ever written for myself, this is a program that scrapes the University of Michigan's job site and dumps the info into a CSV file. Because I currently have an Ann Arbor lease without an Ann Arbor *job*, I've been checking the U-M job site borderline-obsessively. I soon realized that it was difficult and tedious to keep track of which jobs I should apply for next, and I kept thinking, "Man, this would be so much easier if it was all in a spreadsheet." So I decided it was a great excuse to learn the basics of web scraping and wrote this little program.

## [medicaid-expansion-analysis](https://github.com/bdiamond2/medicaid-expansion-analysis)  
I recently applied for a data analysis job that dealt with Medicaid data, so for that I wanted to put together a small project where I pulled data from multiple sources and provided some basic visualizations. This one examines quality-of-life statistics in states that haven't implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion, and stacks them up with the rest of the country. It's not very rigorous or scientific, but I did think the results were fairly interesting.
